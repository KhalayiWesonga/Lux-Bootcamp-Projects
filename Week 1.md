# Let's say you're a Product Data Scientist at Instagram, how would you measure the success of the Instagram TV product?

To measure the success of the IGTV product, one has to identify the Key Performance Indicators(KPIs) which are measurable values used by organizations to track their progress towards their goals.
Here are some of the KPIs that can be used to measure the success of IGTV.

**USER ENGAGEMENT**
Analyzing the number of IGTV video views(how many IGTV videos did the users consume) and the corresponding watchtime(did the user watch the video till the end or did they scroll past it)
Look into the average number of actons(likes, comments and shares)
How much time on average is used on IGTV in comparison to other instagram features like posts, reels and stories.

**USER GROWTH AND RETENTION**
How many new users are interacting/creating using the IGTV product.
Do the creators come back to use IGTV again?

**CONTENT PERFORMANCE**
What type of content is most interacted with(tutorials, entertainment, edits, recorded lives etc)
What content is recommended more by the algorithm

**TECHNICAL METRICS**
How is the video resolution and quality?
What is the loading rate of the IGTV videos.

**MONETIZATION AND DESIRED ACTIONS**
